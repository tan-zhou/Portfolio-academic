## Overview



My Role: User Researcher working under a leading researcher 

Project Overview:  I explore design principles for incorporating self-tracked step counts in data-driven stickers as a first step towards integrating these data into Snapchat posts or Instagram Stories.



Methods: Literature review, Survey, R, Original logistic regression 

Data Sources: Interview transcripts, Literature  

Skills: Interviewing, descriptive statistical analysis, thematic analysis, usability testings, survey

Deliverables: 1) Research report, 2) Persona, 3) Design Patterns

Tools: Google Docs, Google Slides, Google Forms



Background/Context: When people set health and behavior goals such as training for half-marathon, going to bed earlier, or losing weight, they often use social media to share their progress with friends and family (Munson, 2012). Epstein et al. (2015) identified that many people share personal informatics data to receive advisory information, emotional support, motivation, or accountability from their audience. However, prior research has shown that sharing data on social media is often met with ambivalence or no response at all (Epstein, 2019). 



## Objective

When users send or receive Snapchat stickers that contain personal data about step counts,

* What factors influence user perceptions of those stickers?   
* How do these factors influence user perceptions? 



## Opportunity and Process

### Opportunity

In Snapchat or Instagram stories, people use stickers to customize their posts for informative, aesthetic, or entertaining purposes. These stickers are presented in a variety of categories depending on the containing information, presentations, styles, etc. Currently, these story features include methods for sharing some types of data, but the data is typically about the environment rather than the person who is sharing. (Habib et al., 2019). This gives me an opportunity to design a series of stickers to support more types of user-generated content that are focusing on sharers’ goals



 

In this project, I specifically explored and evaluated the design of stickers in one of the most commonly-tracked and often-shared domain -- step counts. 

### Process

we design a series of stickers for Snapchat that contains personal data about step counts and conducted an online survey on how design factors in the stickers influence people’s perceptions.   



Through literature review, I identified a series of predictors that potentially have an influence on Snapchat users. And I took the survey approach to evaluate how they influence user perceptions.

## Strategy

Operationalize the questions

Potential influencing factors: 



User Perception measurements

I draw from literature in online advertising and multimedia study and measure user perceptions from the following five dimensions: Entertaining, Privacy disclosure, Intention to use, Positivity, and Informative.

Survey questions to measure entertaining:

I would find this Snap fun to send.

I would find this Snap fun to receive 



Survey Sampling 

For this study, I’m interested in the opinions of adult Snapchat users. I choose to used convenience sampling for which I sent out recruiting emails to a list of a student research group. I also handed out copies of the flyer with links to the survey in university classrooms and meetings.

 

Survey Screening 

I used two criteria to decide whether a person should be allowed to participate in the online survey: 

• Participants need to be at least 18 years old.

• Participants, on average, send or view at least one post on Snapchat per week.



## Outcomes 

we can see that recipients’ perceptions show more significant correlations with our independent variables, compared with sharers’ perceptions. 

And that influence that factors have on the two sides – Sharer and Recipient – are not received equally. 

When the relevance of stickers’ presentations changes from irrelevant to relevant, the ratings increase in both sharers and recipients’ intention to use, recipients’ level of entertaining, as well as informative. 

Context is significant to ratings of Attitude and Entertaining from recipients.

Stickers design with “Analogy” is perceived to be more exciting to receive than “Plaintext”. 

## Conclusion/Reflection

I explore design principles for incorporating self-tracked step counts in data-driven stickers as a first step towards integrating these data into Snapchat posts or Instagram Stories. I examine the effect of a sticker’s presentation style, domain-relevance, and background through surveys. We uncover the importance of domain-relevant backgrounds and stickers, identify the situational value of stickers styled as analogies, embellished, and badges, and demonstrate that data-driven stickers can make content more informative and entertaining. 

We only received valid answers from 19 participants. This means that our results from regression analyses are highly troubled by sampling error. It is impossible to draw any conclusion that is statistically valid from such a small sample size. Another limitation in the analyses is that no interaction terms were included in the model, because our data sample are simply not powerful enough to discern any differences. However, considering the pilot nature of the project, the process the study took to reach these conclusions are still a meaningful learning experience. 

Indeed, the learnings of this pilot directly influence the research questions and analysis approach when the pilot was later developed into a larger, more comprehensive study with 506 total participants. The findings were published in  [Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3415166) in October 2020.
