## Overview



My Role: UX Researcher in a team of 5 researchers



Project Overview: I worked as part of a team to design best practices for facilitating online monetary donations to small charities and non-profits. Through competitive analysis, interviews, and user behavior/motivations analysis pertaining to charities, we developed design patterns for non-profit organizations to increase trust and call for action within volunteers.



Methods: Literature review, Interviews, Competitive Analysis. Design patterns 

Data Sources: Interview transcripts, Literature  

Skills: Interviewing, descriptive statistical analysis, thematic analysis, usability testings, survey

Deliverables: 1) Research report, 2) Persona, 3) Design Patterns

Tools: Google Docs, Google Slides, Google Forms



Background/Context: Donors are often the core providers of resources for a charity. Without donor support, some charities are likely to quickly struggle to function and are likely to enter a path of decline. Thus, it is very important for charities to connect with their donors in order to gain their trust and motivation. This project was an attempt towards building a theory of persuasion surrounded by trust and commitment for small charity websites.

## Objective

* How can convert a user’s motivation to action in helping small charities online?  
* How can we help small charities establish trust and engagement through Design?



## Opportunity and Process

### Opportunity

We delved into persuasive design literature to create design patterns that enhance the experience for millennial when they visit small charitable websites. We recommended four design patterns concerned with converting user’s motivation into action by identifying impediments to charitable donations. The patterns that emerged were “Trust through reputation”, “Trust through transparency”, “Trust through social circle”, and “Commitment through Engagement”



 

### Process

We conducted an analysis of charitable websites to understand the design process they follow to convert user motivation into calls for action. We interviewed 9 donors to understand their perspectives on these websites. From the insights we gained, we reframed our research questions and refocused our research on establishing online trust and engagement through better design. We used the persuasive design frame as a guide to frame our research question. 



## Strategy

Competitive Analysis 

We analyzed websites of well-establish charities to explore different donation models, including WWF, UNICEF, Facebook Fundraisers, GoFundMe, etc..  We examed their user base, information architecture, messaging approach, calls to action, emotional designs, accreditation, and social influence. The competitive analysis provides us key insights that help us in determining interview questions.



Interviews 

We conducted interviews with 9 individual participants who are either active online donors or have donated through these websites. The interviews highlighted the key points that either

motivated or discouraged donors as they navigated through the charity online. We focused on the statement “a person donates if he or she…” and inferred a list of motivations from the interviews. We exercised inductive reasoning to detect themes from our list of motivations with respect to selected target behaviors.



Design Patterns

My team developed a series of design patterns that translated our findings into executable solutions and assisted website designers and developers of small charities in converting potential donors' motivations to actions. 



Patterns are structured as follow to ensure they are concise, memorable, and easy to apply:

* A concise and memorable title
* Statement\[s] describing the problem or challenge
* Description and discussion on solving the problem
* Solutions that are likely to succeed
* Solutions that are typical yet undesirable



## Outcomes 

Trust is critical 

* Trust is often critical when converting charitable motivations to actions
* Monotonous, one-way interactions do not help donors help engaged or fulfilled



Concise, memorable, and applicable design patterns

Our design patterns were concise and memorable with explicit descriptions of the relevant problems and common pitfalls that should be avoided. Patterns directly address the following donor issues

## Conclusion/Reflection

In this project, we conducted competitive analysis, interviews and analyzed user behavior/motivations pertaining to charities. We developed design patterns for non-profit organizations to increase trust and call for action within volunteers.



Although designs from the patterns may contribute to the increasing in the call for actions by building trust and commitment, this effect is not guaranteed.

We look forward to extending the design patterns to incorporate other factors that are

responsible for designing a charitable website. Considering these discussions, we will conduct more user studies to develop more design patterns, eventually forming a pattern language to convert motivation into action on charitable websites. The language will be

distributed to researchers, designers, developers, and teachers for further validation and expansion. We hope that the language will nd a place in the design process of charitable websites and will contribute to the area of design for the call for action.
